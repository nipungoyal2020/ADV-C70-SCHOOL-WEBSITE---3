            <h1>MS.NATASHA CHHABRA</h1>
            <h2>DEAR PARENTS
                Greetings!

                As someone once said, “Education is the key to success!”
                We, at Presidium Sonipat, understand the pertinent role that education plays in the lives of young ones. Our aim at Presidium is to foster excellence in education as we relentlessly work towards providing our students with the right foundation thus enabling them to spell success for themselves.

                We believe in imparting education to enable students not just to earn a livelihood but also prepare them for success in life. This holistic approach is what we call ‘Education for Life,’ which gives them the wings they need to reach their ultimate goal of life and be what they want to be!

                The Academies at Presidium nurture the talent of each and every Presidian by providing them world-class exposure and raise them into leaders in their chosen walk of life. Ample opportunities are given to students to explore their potential and showcase their inherent skills to the world.

                And we strongly believe this overall development has only been possible with the whole hearted support of our Parent community.

                I must say, our Parents have always appreciated the school's efforts and stood by us to make this place a Dream School for our learners.

                I further invite all parents to partner with us and make this journey of education a pleasant one for all our leaders.

                Best Wishes
                Regards
                Principal

It is housed in what is referred to as the Art Block. It has a fully equipped kitchen and serves hygienic food to the students. The menu ranges from South Indian to Chinese. A committee comprising of parent reps and staff are responsible for its close supervision. The Canteen Committee meets regularly to inspect the premises as well as discuss the menu. All biodegradable food is regularly put in the compost pit behind the canteen. The canteen uses steel utensils only and has done away with all single use plastic containers. A CCTV placed inside the kitchen allows for regular surveillance and maintenance of hygiene standards. Break time sees the students in large numbers engaged in discussions and enjoying the food served in the canteen. It is the favourite place of Sanskritians, staff and students alike.</p>

Comfy clothes are a benefit, but sometimes it is difficult for students to approach online learning with the same structure as they would a traditional school. While students don’t have to get up at a specific time and get dressed each day, attendance is still important.

Many studies, however, have been conducted on the importance of school attendance. This data spans the traditional and online environment. The bottom line: to be successful in education, you must show up!

Here are some tips to help online learners ensure they are engaged every day.</p>
